\chapter{Theory}
\label{chap:theory}

This chapter begins with an introduction to the physics behind the forming of ice on structures. The next two sections briefly describe the measurement parameters and some practical problems of measuring icing. The last section is about scattering of light by small particles.

\section{Forming of Ice}

An icing event can be divided in the incubation, the accretion and the persistance/ablation phase. Atmospheric icing is the period of time where atmospheric conditions are present for the accretion of ice or snow on structures \cite{iea2017}. The icing process is complex and the result depends on a combination of the aerodynamic shape of the structure or airfoil, the velocity of the air and its contained water, the temperature, the mixing of snow and water, the concentration of liquid water and the droplet size distribution.

A particle’s eagerness to follow the flow or collide depends on the flow velocity, the size and shape of the obstacle, the density and drag coefficient of the particle. This relationship is known in fluid mechanics as the Stokes number ($Stk$). Small droplets or particles with $Stk \ll1$ may continue with the airflow around the profile, while large droplets or particles with $Stk \gg 1$ due to their inertia collide with the structure. A supercooled droplet colliding with a structure would likely freeze on the impact. Figure \ref{fig:freezedrops} illustrates the difference between large and small supercooled droplets passing an aerodynamic profile.

Icing on wind turbines forms slightly differently from the ice accretion on an aircraft airfoil. Since the turbine is stationary it cannot stop the icing, or de-ice by moving to a different position. The same conditions may persist for days or weeks. The turbine blade moves concentrically making the tip of the blade the fastest, and highest located moving part. There is no status surveillance of the wings. Therefore the remote and exposed position makes it difficult to detect ice directly when it is initially formed \cite{homo2006}.

\section{Liquid Water Content and Median Volume Diameter}

The liquid water content (LWC) and the water droplets median volume diameter (MVD) are parameters that can be used to predict or model icing. The  MVD is given at the point where half of the total volume of liquid content in a fixed air volume consists of droplets with diameters larger and the other half has smaller diameters. The MVD has been assumed to give the best approximation to the spectrum of diameters in a droplet distribution, when considering the collision efficency \cite{fins1988}. To estimatie the amount of icing created by supercooled water droplets, for most cases the MVD has been shown to be a good indicator \cite{makk2000}. This model using the MVD can also be used for simulating ice accretion on wind turbines \cite{dier2011}.

In practice, the LWC and the MVD are scarcely ever measured at a planned or existing wind turbine \cite{parent2011, makk1992}. Measuring these properties accurately and frequently would be an advantage for the planning of new wind mill farms or for the application of anti-icing arrangements on existing power stations. It may be of particular interest as input to weather prediction models by which both LWC and MVD can be computed \cite{thomp2009, nyga2011}. In combination with information about the aerodynamic properties of the wind turbine, it can give more accurate predictions of icing or even result in better design of wind turbines and anti-icing methods.

While icing caused by large supercooled droplets, with diameters from approximately 50 μm to exceeding 1000 μm, is often considered severe due to its shape and quick build-up, icing may occur even with droplets as small as 5 μm \cite{sand1984, cob2001, homo2010}. In most cases, though, icing is caused by cloud droplets measuring between 10 μm and 30 μm in diameter \cite{makk1992, cob2001}.

Although optical imaging and other techniques for measuring aerosol properties is continuously improving, the choice of instrument is still very much dependent on the application’s requirements \cite{ide1999, baum1983, baum2011, kulk2011}. An instrument for measuring icing parameters for wind turbines should be able to detect supercooled cloud droplets from five micrometer and determine an accurate measure of the LWC. Since measurements are needed in multiple remote locations it should also be affordable, reliable, have low power consumption, and ideally be possible to place near the highest point of the turbine \cite{homo2006}.

\section{Practical Problems with Measuring Atmospheric Water}

The varying nature of atmospheric water particles mentioned in the previous chapter makes it very difficult to measure all kinds and sizes of particles using a single instrument. Therefore atmospheric aerosol studies are often done with one or several instruments combining different techniques. Each technique has its limitations and problems. It is also difficult to find a reference sample with the same but known properties as the water. Free floating water drolets tend to be affected by gravity, collide and coalesce, evaporate or stick to any surface. 

The size of water droplets range from a few micrometers to several mm in diameter. An imaging instrument is limited by the optical system's resolution, it's field of view and the usable depth of field or the measuring range.

Many existing instruments suffer from errors caused by the instrument itself during sampling, e.g. when droplets get stuck on the inlet \cite{spie2012}. At higher wind speeds particles shatter into smaller droplets or bounce on the supporting structure making up the instrument \cite{cohen1991,field2006}. All droplets or particles approaching an obstacle are affected by the change in pressure and wind direction surrounding it, a fact which complicates measuring the concentration of particles in unaffected air. Measurement probes working by extraction of air using a mechanical air pump would expect a loss of particles with large Stokes numbers. Ideally the measuring device should be designed in order to affect the free flow of particles as little as possible \cite{baum2011}.

An instrument that use the fact that supercooled water droplets will freeze on the impact, is e.g. the rotating cylinders used by Makkonen \cite{makk1992}. By exposing cylinders of different diameters, depending on the amount of ice accumulated on each cylinder, the MVD and LWC can be calculated from a theoretical model. While this technique provides a nice alternative to the single particle measurements its drawback is that it requires some manual operation and of course the fact that only freezing water can be measured.

Measuring particles from aircraft is partly made complicated by the high air speed. The sample is affected by the change in pressure surrounding the aircraft and by particles hitting parts of the probe, splintering or changing direction. (ref) An instrument fixed to the ground on the other hand is affected by the wind speed relative to the ground. This means that it needs to be directed in the direction of the wind. Particles may also enter the measurement zone from different directions depending on their Stokes number, which has been shown to have an effect on the measured liquid water content \cite{henn2013}.

Instruments based on Mie calculations of light scattering have sometimes the issue of dealing with a non-linear relation between scattering response and diameter. Aliasing in the sample bin resolution can lead to spikes in the size distribution. Particularly interesting is the 10 to 15 μm range, where two particles with diameters differing more than one micrometer can have the same scattering intensity response \cite{dye1984,spie2012,bohr2008}.

\section{Light Scattering and Absorption}

In visible light, water is almost transparent. This means that the imaginary part of the refractive index, i.e. the absorption, is very small, while for some higher and lower wavelengths it increases with a factor of almost ten power to ten \cite{kou1993}. This fact is used in two-color lidar measurements \cite{west2010}. The real part of the refractive index for water is much more stable, approximately 1.34 at 455 nm light \cite{hale1973}. For simplicity we have assumed that the refractive index of air is equal to one. 

A droplet works as a spherical lens with a very short focal length. Exposed to a background illumination it will scatter almost all of the light reaches the droplet in different directions, causing a shadow that appears as a black disc except for the refracted light passing straight through the center. Some of the light will of course be absorbed, albeit the absorption of a single water droplet is negligible due to its small volume and because water absorb very little in the visible spectrum.

When the light source is spread out compared with the size of the droplets, as in the case of using a collimated LED, the intensity of the center Arago spot caused by Fresnel diffraction would be negligible \cite{reis2017}.

The combined effect of scattering and absorption is the extinction \cite{bohr2008}. Due to this combined effect, clouds look nontransparent from a distance. Measuring extinction is possible in aerosols e.g. by using Raman LIDAR \cite{ans1990}.
