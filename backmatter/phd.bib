abstract = {A fully stochastic model for the imaging properties of X-ray silicon pixel detectors is presented. Both integrating and photon counting configurations have been considered, as well as scintillator-coated structures. The model is based on three levels of Monte Carlo simulations; photon transport and absorption using MCNP, full band Monte Carlo simulation of charge transport and system level Monte Carlo simulation of the imaging performance of the detector system. In the case of scintillator-coated detectors, the light scattering in the detector layers has been simulated using a Monte Carlo method. The image resolution was found to be much lower in scintillator-coated systems due to large light spread in thick scintillator layers. A comparison between integrating and photon counting readout methods shows that the image resolution can be slightly enhanced using a photon-counting readout. In addition, the proposed model has been used to study charge-sharing effects on the energy resolution in photon counting detectors. The simulation shows that charge-sharing effects are pronounced in pixel detectors with a pixel size below 170 ?? 170 ??m2. A pixel size of 50 ?? 50 ??m2 gives a highly distorted energy spectrum due to charge sharing. This negative effect can only be resolved by introducing advanced counting schemes, where neighbouring pixels communicate in order to resolve the charge sharing. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Here a boron-carbide-based thermoelectric device for the detection of a thermal-neutron flux is proposed. The very high melting temperatures and the radiation tolerance of boron carbides make them suitable for use within hostile environments (e.g., within nuclear reactors). The large anomalous Seebeck coefficients of boron carbides are exploited in proposing a relatively sensitive detector of the local heating that follows the absorption of a neutron by a B-10 nucleus in a boron carbide.

It gives the possibility of understanding experimental results and it allows the construction of virtual imaging setups with predictions of their quality. For these reasons, we developed the Roentgen Simulation (ROSI) which is based on the object-oriented C++ class library GISMO. The interaction algorithms are based on the established EGS4-code and its current LSCAT-extension. ROSI introduces random variables for modelling physical parameters by a given random distribution, e.g. the source position or the direction and energy of the photons to be emitted. It is possible to run ROSI in parallel on a local computer network (Beowulf cluster) to obtain simulation data in shorter time. Finally, it has an easy-to-use interface. We will present the concept of ROSI and demonstrate its flexibility by an example.},

abstract = {EIGER is an advanced family of single photon counting hybrid pixel detectors, primarily aimed at diffraction experiments at synchrotrons. Optimization of maximal functionality and minimal pixel size (using a 0.25??m process and conserving the radiation tolerant design) has resulted in 75??75??
                        m2 pixels. Every pixel comprises a preamplifier, shaper, discriminator (with a 6 bit DAC for threshold trimming), a configurable 4/8/12 bit counter with double buffering, as well as readout, control and test circuitry. A novel feature of this chip is its double buffered counter, meaning a next frame can be acquired while the previous one is being readout. An array of 256??256 pixels fits on a ???2??2
                        cm2 chip and a sensor of ???8??4
                        cm2 will be equipped with eight readout chips to form a module containing 0.5 Mpixel. Several modules can then be tiled to form larger area detectors. Detectors up to 4??8 modules (16 Mpixel) are planned. To achieve frame rates of up to 24 kHz the readout architecture is highly parallel, and the chip readout happens in parallel on 32 readout lines with a 100 MHz Double Data Rate clock. Several chips and singles (i.e. a single chip bump-bonded to a single chip silicon sensor) were tested both with a lab X-ray source and at Swiss Light Source (SLS) beamlines. These tests demonstrate the full functionality of the chip and provide a first assessment of its performance. High resolution X-ray images and high speed movies were produced, even without threshold trimming, at the target system frame rates (up to ???24kHz in 4 bit mode). In parallel, dedicated hardware, firmware and software had to be developed to comply with the enormous data rate the chip is capable of delivering. Details of the chip design and tests will be given, as well as highlights of both test and final readout systems. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) represents a powerful clinical technology, but a systematic characterization of the electrical interactions between the electrode and the brain is lacking. The goal of this study was to examine the in vivo changes in the DBS electrode impedance that occur after implantation and during clinically relevant stimulation. Clinical DBS devices typically apply high-frequency voltage-controlled stimulation, and as a result, the injected current is directly regulated by the impedance of the electrode-tissue interface. We monitored the impedance of scaled-down clinical DBS electrodes implanted in the thalamus and subthalamic nucleus of a rhesus macaque using electrode impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements ranging from 0.5 Hz to 10 kHz. To further characterize our measurements, equivalent circuit models of the electrode-tissue interface were used to quantify the role of various interface components in producing the observed electrode impedance. Following implantation, the DBS electrode impedance increased and a semicircular arc was observed in the high-frequency range of the EIS measurements, commonly referred to as the tissue component of the impedance. Clinically relevant stimulation produced a rapid decrease in electrode impedance with extensive changes in the tissue component. These post-operative and stimulation-induced changes in impedance could play an important role in the observed functional effects of voltage-controlled DBS and should be considered during clinical stimulation parameter selection and chronic animal research studies.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a numerical study of charge sharing in photon-counting X-ray imaging detectors. The study is based on charge transport simulations combined with a system level Monte Carlo simulation code to calculate the energy resolution of different pixel detector configurations. Our simulations show that the charge sharing is very sensitive to the electric field distribution in the device, and that the higher doping levels used in the GaAs detector reduce the effect of charge sharing significantly. Our study concludes that one of advantages in using very heavy semiconductor materials in X-ray imaging detectors is the possibility to suppress charge sharing utilizing structures with much higher electric field. A 100-\&amp;mu;m-thick epitaxial GaAs detector absorbs 52\% of the photons, while a 300-\&amp;mu;m-thick silicon (detector absorbs only 8\% of the photons (30 keV source). In addition to the superior stopping power, the GaAs detector has five times lower charge diffusion, resulting in superior spatial and energy resolution.},

The stimulation is currently administered using tetrode-macroelectrodes that target the subthalamic nucleus (STN). This often leads to side effects which bias the surrounding ar- eas, e.g. the speech centre. Targeting a spe- cific brain region can better be achieved with micro-stimulation electrodes with directed elec- trical field distribution. Experimental studies showed the effectiveness of microelectrode DBS by comparing neurotransmitter outflow before and after the stimulation. The neurotransmit- ter outflow in close proximity to the stimulation is hereby measured by means of microdialysis. To establish ideal distances and stimulation strength, the electric potential around the stim- ulation electrode and microdialysis membrane were modelled using comsol Multiphysics.},

The prototype pixel read-out chip has a noise of 75e- with sensor, a low threshold dispersion and a maximum count rate of 1 MHz/pixel. Due to the expected radiation dose in operation at the beamline, the chip is designed in radiation hard DMILL technology. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Often CAD models already exist for parts of a geometry being simulated using GEANT4. Direct import of these CAD models into GEANT4 however, may not be possible and complex components may be difficult to define via other means. Solutions that allow for users to work around the limited support in the GEANT4 toolkit for loading predefined CAD geometries have been presented by others, however these solutions require intermediate file format conversion using commercial software. Here within we describe a technique that allows for CAD models to be directly loaded as geometry without the need for commercial software and intermediate file format conversion. Robustness of the interface was tested using a set of CAD models of various complexity; for the models used in testing, no import errors were reported and all geometry was found to be navigable by GEANT4.},

abstract = {HEXITEC is a collaborative project with the aim of developing a new range of detectors for high-energy X-ray imaging. High-energy X-ray imaging has major advantages over current lower energy imaging for the life and physical sciences, including improved phase-contrast images on larger, higher density samples and with lower accumulated doses. However, at these energies conventional silicon-based devices cannot be used, hence, the requirement for a new range of high Z-detector materials. Underpinning the HEXITEC programme are the development of a pixellated Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CZT) detectors and a pixellated readout ASIC which will be bump-bonded to the detector. The HEXITEC ASIC is required to have low noise (20 electrons rms) and tolerate detector leakage currents. A prototype 20??20 pixel ASIC has been developed and manufactured on a standard 0.35 ??m CMOS process. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Rollins1988,
abstract = {A computer program has been written to allow simultaneous solution
of an electrical network containing both nonlinear circuit elements and
two-dimensional finite-element solid-state models. The circuit solver is
based on the popular SPICE-II program, while the PISCES-II program is
used to model the solid-state devices. Both steady-state DC and
time-dependent solutions are possible. Additional features have also
been added to the solid-state model, including photogeneration and the
optional use of cylindrical coordinates},

@inproceedings{Krapohl2010a,
abstract = {X-ray imaging with spectral resolution, “Color X- ray imaging” is a new imaging technology that is currently attracting a lot of attention. It has however been observed that the quality of spectral response is degraded as the pixel size is reduced. This is an effect of charge sharing where the signal from a photon absorbed close to the border between two pixels is shared between pixels. This effect is caused by both diffusion during the charge transport and X-ray fluorescence in heavy detector materials [1]. In order to understand the behavior of pixellated detectors with heavy detector materials operating in single photon processing mode, we have simulated the X-ray interaction with the sensor and the transport of the charge to the readout electrode using a Monte Carlo model for the X-ray interaction and a drift diffusion model for the charge transport. By combining these models, both signal and noise properties of the detector can be simulated.},
