\chapter{Acknowledgements}

I would like to express the greatest gratitude to my supervisor, Benny Thörnberg, for his trust and encouragement during hard times when things did not turn out the way they were expected.
I would also like to thank Mattias O'Nils and Claes Mattsson at the Electronics Department for making the project possible and giving me the possibility to finish the thesis. A big thank is also given to the Swedish Energy Agency for funding most of the work, Patrik Jonsson, Björn Ollars and Olof Carlsson at Combitech for their invaluable work with integrating the CDP and Esbjörn Olsson at SMHI for sharing his knowledge about the weather physics and his work with the NWP model data.
The greatest love and gratitute towards my wonderful family that have sacrificed and supported me in beginning, fulfilling and finishing this work. Without you this would not have been possible.
